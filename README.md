# Admin-Dashboard


The Administrative Dashboard** provides administrators direct access to important Encompass tools for faster and more convenient community management.


The Dashboard serves as an administrative home page with access to key components of your community. The Dashboard not only offers an “at a glance” look at your events, donation campaigns, and e-mails, but also serves as a launching point for frequent actions including creating an e-mail, adding a campaign, adding photos, adding members, and more. In addition, you’ll receive important announcements from Encompass and have your institution’s personal Encompass contact information all in one location.

Based on individual administrative rights, modules can be added from the Add Modules bar. Additionally, modules can be deleted from the layout (when deleted, the module returns to the Add Modules bar and can be added again at any time). The administrator can move the modules to any preferred layout arrangement.
